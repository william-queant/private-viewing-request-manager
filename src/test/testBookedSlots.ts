// Test script to verify booked slot functionality
// This file helps test the feature implementation

/*
Testing Scenario:
1. Property Manager approves a slot for a tenant
2. That same date/time slot should show as "Booked" and disabled for other tenants
3. Booked slots should have visual indicators (line-through, gray color, disabled state)

Steps to test manually:
1. Go to tenant view (Ryan Fox or Sally Mason)
2. Request a private viewing and select some time slots
3. Go to Property Manager view (Ava Wright)
4. Approve one of the requested slots
5. Go back to a different tenant view
6. Try to request a viewing for the same date - the approved time slot should be disabled

Expected behavior:
- Approved slots show as disabled with "(Booked)" text
- Approved slots have line-through text decoration
- Approved slots cannot be selected by other tenants
- The UI clearly indicates which slots are unavailable
